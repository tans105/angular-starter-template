# `anguler-starter-template` â€” the seed for AngularJS templating 

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS][angularjs] web app. You can use it
to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these projects.

The seed contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the Angular
framework and a bunch of routing for instant web development gratification.



## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the the repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the repository


### Clone `angular-starter-template`

Clone the repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/tans105/angular-starter-template.git
```

### Install Dependencies

In order to get all the angular dependencies, we would require bower. Here are few links if you are new to bower

https://bower.io/<br>
https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower

Once you got bower up and running, go to the project directory and run 

```
bower install
```

After that, you should find out that you have a new folders in your project.

* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
`angular-seed` changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file. Putting it in the `app` folder
makes it easier to serve the files by a web server.*
